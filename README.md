# Project 5: C-Language CFD Project with MPI & OpenMP
The current repository presents codes that implement a parallelized version of one of the most common partial differential equations, the Burgers’ equation. The equation
is named after Johannes Martinus Burgers, and has applications in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid dynamics, nonlinear acoustics, molecular gas dynamics, and traffic flow. Although parallelization of this partial differential
equation is not a new thing, our approach will focus on exploiting the intel based library, the MPI and OpenMP libraries to get the peak performance. Our aim is to surpass the performance of OpenFOAM, which is a free open source code known for solving
pde’s in MPI environments.
